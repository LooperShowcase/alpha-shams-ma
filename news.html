    Competition pools World Championship pools must be 50 metres (160 ft) (long
    course) long and 25 metres (82 ft) wide, with ten lanes labelled zero to
    nine (or one to ten in some pools; zero and nine (or one and ten) are
    usually left empty in semi-finals and finals); the lanes must be at least
    2.5 metres (8.2 ft) wide. They will be equipped with starting blocks at both
    ends of the pool and most will have Automatic Officiating Equipment,
    including touch pads to record times and sensors to ensure the legality of
    relay takeovers. The pool must have a minimum depth of two metres.[16] Other
    pools which host events under FINA regulations are required to meet some but
    not all of these requirements. Many of these pools have eight, or even six,
    instead of ten lanes and some will be 25 metres (82 ft) long, making them
    Short course. World records that are set in short course pools are kept
    separate from those set in long course pools because it may be an advantage
    or disadvantage to swimmers to have more or less turns in a race Swim
    England has also warned more than 100 pools are under threat of closure or
    reduced hours due to the energy crisis. It made its "dire forecast" at the
    start of November and said without government help "large numbers of public
    sector leisure facilities are unlikely to make it through to next spring." A
    government spokesperson said: "We know many leisure centres and swimming
    pools are contending with major increases in running costs, which is why we
    have introduced the Energy Bill Relief Scheme. "It will mean they pay
    wholesale energy costs, well below half of expected prices this winter."
    Elsewhere in Europe, France is cutting the temperature of its public
    swimming pools by 1C. Heating in most public buildings in France, Spain and
    Germany is being capped at 19C to help tackle the crisis. Italy is also
    limiting heating in public buildings. Better Leisure's network of sport
    facilities stretch from St Ives in Cornwall to Newcastle Upon Tyne, with the
    majority centred around Cumbria, Manchester, Oxfordshire and London.
